= Reference

clojurephant uses the common Gradle pattern of providing both _capability_ plugins and _convention_ plugins.

Capability plugins:: provide the basic machinery for using the language, but leaves it to you to configure
Convention plugins:: extend the capability plugin to provide configuration on top of the capabilities to support common use cases

TIP: Most people should apply the _convention_ plugins. The capability plugins are for lower level configuration, more suited to an experienced user that doesn't want the default behavior.
