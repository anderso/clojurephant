= Java Support

Applies the Gradle built-in `java` plugin to get convention-based support for the JVM ecosystem.

The high-level features of the `java` plugin are:

* Creating a `main` source set for your production code
* Creating a `jar` task that packages the `main` source set's output
* Creating a `test` source set for use with JUnit testing
** The `test` source set depends on the `main` source set's output (i.e. Java classes)
** Creates a `test` task to execute the tests
